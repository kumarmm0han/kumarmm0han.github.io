Goat Biryani and a Goat liver fry are our traditional menu. \\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nHere is the Recipe,\\n\\nIngredients & Steps:\\n\\nPrep work for Rice:\\n\\nWe use Basmati Rice. Wash 4 cups of rice and soak the rice in water for minimum 2 hours.\\n\\nPrep work for mutton (goat meat):\\n\\nFor 4 cups of rice we buy 3-4lbs of goat meat.  We have a habit of washing the meat using Turmeric ( may contain antibacterial &  antimicrobial properties ). \\n\\nPressure cook the meat with enough water, salt & with few cumin seeds. Preserve the soup as that will be used later to cook the rice.\\n\\nFor pastes:\\n\\n1. Ginger & Garlic Paste:\\n\\nPeel and grind ginger & garlic together and make a paste. \\n\\n2. Green Paste:\\n\\nGrind 2 full punch of Mint leaves, Coriander leaves  & green chillies(based on the spice level)  and make a green paste. \\n\\nFor Aroma\\n\\n Few bay leaves, piece cinnamon, cloves, cardamom,  star anise, cumin seeds(hand full of), peppercorns \\n\\nOthers:\\n\\n1 full size red onions finely chopped, 2 tomatoes & curry leaves\\n\\nInstructions:\\n\\n1. Use a thick bottom pan or a pressure cooker for preparation. For 4 cups of rice 5 liter pressure cooker hold good.\\n\\n2.  Heat sunflower oil and ghee in a pan until hot and then add the aromatics \\n\\n3. Add the finely chopped onions and curry leaves  and fry it till golden brown and leave it till caramelized. This is very important step.\\n\\n4. Add the ginger & garlic paste and fry it till the raw smell goes away\\n\\n5. Add the mint paste and fry it till the raw smell goes away. At this stage we should be able to smell the aroma created by the mint & caramelized onions\\n\\n6. Add the tomatoes and cook for few mins\\n\\n7. Add the cooked meat\\n\\n8. Add the soup and water for cooking rice. We go by the measure of 1cup rice = 1.5 cup of water. Add all the mutton soup first and add water based on the needs\\n\\n9. Add salt, as this is the last stage we can add salt so make sure to add enough salt for both curry and rice. \\n\\n10. Leave this mix to boil and add the soaked rice (drain the water). Stir once and cover it with lid\\n\\n11. In medium flame Pressure cook for 1-2 whistle or  cook till the rice has absorbed most of the liquid.\\n\\n12. If needed leave it in dum (low flame with tight lid or with pressure cooker lid without whistle ) for few mins\\n\\n13. Serve the hot Biryani with Onion raita"}]}')}}]);
